This blog lists all the different resources I follow to receive software-engineering relevant content from outside company. Such a list can never be complete, so it will continue to grow.

Paraphrasing Joe Armstrong - good content leads to other good content, so I am sure these resources will continue to lead to more good resources.

## Link Aggregators

*   [https://lobste.rs/](https://lobste.rs/) - Computer Science / Software Engineering specific link aggregator
    

## Blogs

Most of these I have discovered via Lobsters and will continue to discover more.
